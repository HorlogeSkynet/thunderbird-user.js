## prefs.js cleaner for Linux/Mac
## /!\ This script is a vendored/adapted version of Arkenfox own prefsCleaner.sh /!\
## author: @claustromaniac
## version: 2.1

## special thanks to @overdodactyl and @earthlng for a few snippets that I stol..*cough* borrowed from the updater.sh

## DON'T GO HIGHER THAN VERSION x.9 !! ( because of ASCII comparison in update_prefsCleaner() )
